{{ alert("This feature is only available in Chrome (except on Android), Firefox, Safari, IE10+, & Opera 15+ due to their support for the
[`ProgressEvent` interface](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/progress/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#interface-progressevent).") }}

Seeing your uploads progress can be a satisfying feeling, especially when they
finish. With Fine Uploader UI mode, a progress bar is included in the UI, and
-- just like any other Fine Uploader UI feature -- it can be completely
rebuilt and rebranded in Core mode.
